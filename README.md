# Regularization and Model Evaluation

In this assignment, we explore regularization and model evaluation by implementing a linear regression model from scratch using non-linear basis functions.

## How to Run

### Part 1 & 2
1. Navigate to the `LinearRegressionNonLinearBasisFunctions/Code` folder.
2. Run the `AnalysisNonLinearRegression.py` file.

### Part 3
1. Navigate to the `LinearRegressionWithCrossValidation/Code` folder.
2. Run the `RegularizationWithCrossValidation.py` file.

## Part 4
1. Navigate to the `Task4/Code` folder.
2. Run the `Losseffectofregularization.py` file.

## Results
Any resulting figures/graphs will be saved in their respective folders:
- `LinearRegressionNonLinearBasisFunctions/Results`: Contains the results for Part 1 & 2
- `LinearRegressionWithCrossValidation/Results`: Contains the results for Part 3
- `Task4/Results`: Contains the results for Part 4

## Helper Functions
The `Helper.py` file contains all the helper functions used throughout this project.
The `PlotHelper.py` file contains all the helper functions used throughout this project for plotting results.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using pip:
