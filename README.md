# Regularization and Model Evaluation

In this assignment, we explore regularization and model evaluation by implementing a linear regression model from scratch using non-linear basis functions.

## How to Run

### Linear Regression with Non-Linear Basis Functions & Bias-Variance Tradeoff with Multiple Fits
1. Navigate to the `LinearRegressionNonLinearBasisFunctions/Code` folder.
2. Run the `AnalysisNonLinearRegression.py` file.

### Regularization with Cross-Validation
1. Navigate to the `LinearRegressionWithCrossValidation/Code` folder.
2. Run the `RegularizationWithCrossValidation.py` file.

## Effect of L1 and L2 Regularization on Loss
1. Navigate to the `Task4/Code` folder.
2. Run the `Losseffectofregularization.py` file.

## Results
Any resulting figures/graphs will be saved in their respective folders:
- `LinearRegressionNonLinearBasisFunctions/Results`: Contains the results for Linear Regression with Non-Linear Basis Functions & Bias-Variance Tradeoff with Multiple Fits
- `LinearRegressionWithCrossValidation/Results`: Contains the results for Regularization with Cross-Validation
- `Task4/Results`: Contains the results for Effect of L1 and L2 Regularization on Loss


## Prerequisites
